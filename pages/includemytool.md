	So.. you have something you would like to contribute? We require that pages hosted on this site satisfy the following requirements:
	<ol>
		<li> It must function without any form of dependency upon a LMS.</li>
		<li> It must be demonstrably open source.</li>
		<li> You must be willing to write a webpage about it that you are happy to release under our Creative Commons Share Alike license.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	If you believe that your tool satisfies these requirements, then we have a <a href="https://github.com/kirsty.kitto/beyondLMS">GitHub repository</a> from which we manage these pages. If you would like to have your tool included on the pages then you should submit a pull request by:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Forking the repository (<a href="https://github.com/kirsty.kitto/beyondLMS">https://github.com/kirsty.kitto/beyondLMS</a>)
		</li>
		<li> 
			Cloning your forked repository
		</li>
		<li>
			Adding a page discussing your tool and the necessary links (remember, all content on these pages is licensed under a Creative Commons Share Alike license). 
		</li>
		<li>
			Commit and make sure you check that your page compiles fine, and look how you want them to look.
		</li>
		<li>
			Push the new page to our main repository and issue a merge request.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		If we are happy with the page, and agree that your tool satisfies our requirements then we will merge it into the main repository and your tool will be listed in our pages. We may ask you to change some stuff first to meet the <a href="">stylistic guidelines</a> of this site.
	</p>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
	If you have a tool that does not satisfy satisfy the open source and CC requirements, but that you think helps people to teach beyond the LMS in some way, then contact us with a link to your tool and we will add it under the proprietary tools page if we agree with you.
